# Creating Multiplication Circuits via Brute Force

A project for the XanaduAI QHack2021 hackathon. [https://github.com/XanaduAI/QHack/issues/11](Submission)

## Overview

It's hard to do multiplication with Quantum Circuits. Current multiplication circuits require a large number of qubits which we don't have.

The goal of this project is to see if we can make the circuit for "A=A\*B" smaller.

Demo so far:
